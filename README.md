# colored-tile-maze
Small project for my AP Computer Science course in high school.
Made a game based on a minigame found in the RPG game Undertale by Toby Fox.
Jar file found under "projects" under "colorTiledMaze"

There is a bug where some of the multiple choice options are listed backwards, which occurs on Mac and not Windows.

Hope you enjoy!
