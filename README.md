# colored-tile-maze
Small project for my AP Computer Science course in high school.
Made a game based on a minigame found in the RPG game Undertale by Toby Fox.
Jar file executes the game.

My project's foundation is the code for GridWorld, which we were using to study and practice for the AP exam.

There is a bug where some of the multiple choice options are listed backwards, which occurs on Mac and not Windows.

Hope you enjoy!
