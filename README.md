# colored-tile-maze
Project for my AP Computer Science course in high school.
Made a game based on a minigame found in the RPG game Undertale by Toby Fox.
JAR file executes the game.

My project's foundation is the code for GridWorld, which we were using to study and practice for the AP exam. The majority of the code I wrote myself can be found under "projects" under "coloredTileMaze".

To just play the game, download ColoredTileMaze.jar, Solution.txt, TemShop.wav, and Tiles.txt. They must all be in the same folder for the JAR file to work.

There is a bug where some of the multiple choice options are listed backwards, which occurs on Mac and not Windows.

Hope you enjoy!
